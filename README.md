# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

This Kaggle competition is a binary image classification problem where you will identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.

You will submit three deliverables: 

Deliverable 1 — A Jupyter notebook with a description of the problem/data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, analysis (model building and training), result, and discussion/conclusion. 

If your project doesn’t fit into Jupyter notebook format (E.g., you built an app that uses ML), write your approach as a report and submit it in a pdf form. 

Deliverable 2 — A public project GitHub repository with your work (please also include the GitHub repo URL in your notebook/report).

Deliverable 3 — A screenshot of your position on the Kaggle competition leaderboard for your top-performing model.
